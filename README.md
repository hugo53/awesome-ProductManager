## Books
- [Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758) by [Steve Krug](http://www.sensible.com/). This is a book about human-computer interaction and web usability. 400 000 copies sold into 20 languages, it's a kind of classic book for all product managers, developers.
- [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004J4XGN6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004J4XGN6&linkCode=as2&tag=theartofproma-20) by [Eric Ries](https://twitter.com/ericries). One of the worst things a PM can do is build a product that nobody wants.  This book shows you how to avoid that by building a minimum viable product and paying attention to the metrics that matter.
- [The Innovator's Dilemma](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062060244/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062060244&linkCode=as2&tag=httpstwit071f-20) by [Clayton M. Christensen](http://www.claytonchristensen.com/). Focusing on _disruptive technology_, Christensen shows why most companies miss out on new waves of innovation. Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, The Innovator’s Dilemma presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.
- [The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E257T6C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00E257T6C&linkCode=as2&tag=theartofproma-20) by [Don Norman](http://www.jnd.org/). [From a product designer's perspective](http://pmblog.quora.com/The-10-Books-Every-Product-Manager-Should-Read), "I consider this the canonical product design book, and it's a great place for anyone to start, especially if you don't already have a background in design. It will show you how to look at the world in terms of design. **After reading this book you'll start to notice good and bad designs all around you.**"
